# PingPong
Ping pong game in Python

I have written this game thanks to that youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6jJg9Zan7w. I added my own
improvements, for example I used object-oriented programming to write this app instead of procedural programming.
I also implemented computer player to my game.
